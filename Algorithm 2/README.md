# Algorithm 2: Greedy Approach to Hamiltonian Problem

## Description
This program determines the optimal city to start a circulae road trip where each city has a gas sation and a fixed fuel capacity. Given the distances between each city, fuel availability, and the vechile's MPG; the algorithm will ensure that the car can complete a round trip starting from a preferred startinf city without running out of fuel.

## Compile

g++ startingcity.cpp -o startingcity

## Run

./startingcity
