# Algorithm 1: Connecting Pairs of Persons

This algorithm solves the problem of arranging couples seated in a row so that each couple sits together with the minimum number of swaps. It has two functions, findPartnerPosition, which locates the partner of a given person in a row. And the main function, connectCouples, which checks each pair of seats and swaps partners if they are not sitting together. 

The algorithm calculates and returns the total number of swaps needed to arrange all couples next to each other. Two test cases have been provided for demonstration.
